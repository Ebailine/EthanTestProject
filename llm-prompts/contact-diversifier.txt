Given a list of potential contacts {name, title, dept, email_confidence}, choose exactly 5 with this mix:
- 2 HR/Recruiting (prioritize campus/university roles)
- 1 head/lead recruiter if present
- 2 people from the hiring team or adjacent team (else include EA to leader)

Prefer email_confidence ≥ 0.7. Return JSON with reason per selection.

Contacts: {{contacts}}

Output format:
{
  "selected_contacts": [
    {
      "contact_id": "uuid",
      "selection_reason": "Brief explanation of why this contact was chosen and their role in outreach",
      "role_in_outreach": "Primary HR contact" | "Lead recruiter" | "Team contact" | "Hiring manager" | "EA backup"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Brief overview of the selected contact mix and strategy"
}

Selection priorities:
1. Campus/University recruiters (highest priority for internships)
2. HR generalists with good email confidence
3. Lead or senior recruiters
4. Team members or hiring managers
5. Executive assistants as fallback
6. Role-based emails (recruiting@, careers@) as last resort

Always return exactly 5 contacts unless fewer than 5 are available.
