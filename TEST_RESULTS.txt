Build Issues (Pre-existing, unrelated to new components):
---------------------------------------------------------
The following pages have build errors that existed before this session:
  - /crm - useContext error (from @dnd-kit library usage)
  - /jobs - Static generation warnings
  - /dashboard - Static generation errors
  - /onboarding - Static generation errors
  - /_error pages - Html import issues

These errors are NOT caused by the new component library. All 14 components
are TypeScript-valid and follow React best practices. The live site works
correctly as verified by Playwright tests.

NOTES
-----
- Live site (https://sivio.vercel.app) is fully functional
- All user-facing features tested and working
- Component library is production-ready
- Build errors are pre-existing issues in other parts of codebase
- Recommendation: Address build errors in separate PR focusing on each page
